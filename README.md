# Oasis Project

Oasis (Open-source Architecture Semantic Iot Service-platform) project aims to develop an open source, intelligent IoT(Internet of Things) service platform based on international standards.

The Oasis project will be provided as open source as the outcome of the â€œ(ICBMS-3 specifics) The IoT Platform for Virtual Things, Distributed Autonomous Intelligence and Data Federation/Analysis" as a newly supported by broadcasting and communication technology development project(2015).

The Oasis project will continue to grow as an open source based on the open source community.

## Main Functions

* Data collection based on the OneM2M standard platform
* Complies with Semantic Web standards such as RDF/OWL
* Semantic Annotation
* Apply reference model for IoT domain such as sensor network ontology (SSNO) and context awareness (DUL)
* Inference function for real-time context awareness
