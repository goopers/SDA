Oasis (Open-source Architecture Semantic Iot Service-platform) project aims to develop an open source, intelligent IoT(Internet of Things) service platform based on international standards.

The Oasis project will be provided as open source as the outcome of the â€œ(ICBMS-3 specifics) The IoT Platform for Virtual Things, Distributed Autonomous Intelligence and Data Federation/Analysis" as a newly supported by broadcasting and communication technology development project(2015).

The Oasis project will continue to grow as an open source based on the open source community.
